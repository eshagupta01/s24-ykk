# Plan for today
- Review the past 3 weeks using a practice midterm
New for today:
- Discuss [Algorithm Analysis](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/AlgorithmAnalysis/WhatIsAlgorithmAnalysis.html)
- Work through algorithm examples
- Review [Recursion](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/Recursion/WhatIsRecursion.html)


# Midterm Review

# Algorithm Analysis

* There are many ways we can try to estimate an algorithm
* For example, we can benchmark the algorithm by calculating the time it takes for something to run
* We can do this in Python using some code:

```
import time

def function_timing(func_name, func_param):
    print("Starting", func_name)
    start = time.time()
    func_name(func_param)
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

def list_insert(total):
    num_list = []
    for num in range(total):
        num_list.insert(0, num)

def list_append(total):
    num_list = []
    for num in range(total):
        num_list.append(num)

num_items = 100
print(f"Testing functions using {num_items} elements")

f1_time = function_timing(list_insert, num_items)
print("list_insert:", f1_time)

f2_time = function_timing(list_append, num_items)
print("list_append:", f2_time)
```

* What are the problems of this approach?

## Asymptotic Behavior
* We want to analyze approximately how fast an algorithm runs when the size of the input approaches infinity
* So instead of calculating the raw time of how fast the algorithm runs on our computers, we can approximate the number of instructions the algorithm will take with respect to the size of the input

## Recursion
* Recursion is when a function contains a call to itself
* The simplest case in a recursive solution is called the base case, the rest of the cases are called recursive cases in which we call the recursive function on a smaller input
